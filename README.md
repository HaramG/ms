There's too much to go over in a short file, sit tight.

I'll start off by clearly stating the goals we'll have to work to produce a quality experience for the people who'll use the website, in addition to the common routes I end up following when thinking about it.

The original vision is to express [thoughts](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/thoughts.md) and let people follow their own patterns smartly on the internet to create a big bubble of joy.

For the sake of scalability and easy management, we will develop a single web app that will work on kinds and shapes of devices. We must keep in mind how fast and the angle at which we will scale the site. This means being able to visualize tiny details day to day.

We will use: 
- Angular2 final release
  - [Universal](https://github.com/angular/universal)
  - [ng2-DND](https://github.com/akserg/ng2-dnd)
  
- AngularFire2
  - Storage
  - Real-time Database
  - Auth

I want you to experience the future for yourself, it's really implicit here.

There's an infinity of things we'll have to do, exactly. So getting this out of the way from the get-go is the key.

As the first developers, we get to choose which areas of the website we work to bringing in reality. We must develop a very strong API that'll allow code-friendly and completely code-obsolete beings to produce content and code.

Ideally, we really push hard on making our own development language and refining it through time. Making it intuitive is pretty much my only job. If you didn't and still want to contribute, here's a list of things we have to get out of the way:
- [Search](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Search/search) function unique to all views
- [Board](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/tree/master/Board) interface for thought management
- [Native](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Native/native-apps.md) apps to develop
- [Notifications](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Notifications/notifications) for all native apps
- [Languages](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/tree/master/languages) to translate for an international experience
- A MAJOR game to design develop, test and flex (can't show you enough of this)

Here are the native app recipes you've cooked sub/consciously as of yet:
- [Circles](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Native/circles/circles) app is a social browsing platform on steroids
- [Exchange](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Native/exchange/exchange) app is a money management platform on steroids
- [Creator](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Native/creator/creator) app is a content creation platform on steroids
- [The Game](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Native/the-game/game) is amazing and integrates all other native apps
- [Browser](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Native/browser/browser) app lets people view global user-made thoughts, which can also be apps. Apps can be installed by any user as a personal native app.

Here's a list of types of thoughts you can create (with the creator, normally):
- [Circle](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/circle); individuals, groups, communities and a congregation of everything
- [App](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/app); user-created, must be available as angular2 component for optimal performance (push em)
- [Widget](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/widget); audio players, com bases, core, shortcuts, store
- [Page](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/page); create profile pages, portfolios, anything you want
- [Collection](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/collection); place thoughts in a serialized manner with neat formatting
- [Memo](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/memo); include tweet-style message + creator profile link to a div that can hold all other thoughts
- [Live stream](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/stream); Interactive timeline stream (this is mostly a data-stream people can tune into and morph into displayable data)
- [Course](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/course); for the teachers and students of the internet
- [Video](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/video); Nice link wrapper for your videos
- [Audio](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/audio); Nice link wrapper for your audios
- [Image](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/image); Nice link wrapper for your images
- [Article](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/article); Text content one should share
- [Product](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/product); Wrap a thought as a product
- [Download](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/download); Download a virus
- [Feed](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/feed); Time-line of thoughts based on settings
- [Poll](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/poll); Vote and have programmatic changes be applied based on settings
- [Progress](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/types/prorgess); Fundraise and track endeavors

Here's a list of attributes you can apply to a thought, as of yet:
- [Characteristics](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/attributes/characteristics.md) (single-view, advertisement, privacy, gore, adult)
- [Tags and Categories](https://github.com/HaramG/ms/blob/master/Thought/attributes/categories%20and%20tags) (for search optimization)
- Widgets (super amazing enhancement to every thought)

Here's a list of programs/progress thoughts that have already been thought of being integrated with this website, globally:
- MS health (non-profit / scalable supplying of nutrition and medication worldwide)
- MS being (non-profit / scalable supplying of computer hardware and knowledge worldwide)
Fill the void for these ones naturally (lol like I even have to type to you anymore ;)

We will ease this project into open-source and let it build itself post-release.
