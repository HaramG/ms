Circles is the upgraded social media that lets users rally together to create groups and form communities naturally.
These are meant to scale all throughout the website, including features from all native apps including the yet-to-be-developed Game.

Circles are all available in the circle Universe part of the database. The Universe is a browsable environment where users can select any circle in order to view important information about that circle. When a circle is selected by click, a pop-around is shown with that circle's intended information displayed. Most commonly, they should include:
- A self-built profile-page, which has a default setup if never [Created]()
- Pinned links
    - [Store]()
    - [Love]()
    - [Stats]()
        - Thoughts created number, which can be clicked to display all thoughts created
        - Total views for all thoughts, which can be clicked to do whatever
        - Total members if type !== 'individual'
        - Total lovers
        - [Goldness]() % in type
    - [Copy]()
    - Custom [icons]() or trophies displayed above the circle's picture
    - A Goldness spot which is filled with the current goldness level pattern
- Most popular thought
- Showcased thought

These settings can be easily edited by the user(s) with appropriate rights by simply dragging the updated thought to replace the old one. More explained in [Clipboard]() and [Bookmarks](). Also important to add, at launch or soon-after launch, the option for groups and communities to evolve programmatically with [poll]()s that can affect thoughts and settings within those. This will be the most important feature for the Congregation, down the line.

Clicking their profile, showcased and popular thoughts, store should open the thought in the respective appropriate app. Here we have [Browser](), [Exchange]() or otherwise it can be a [Widget]() which opens itself in the [Bookmarks]().
